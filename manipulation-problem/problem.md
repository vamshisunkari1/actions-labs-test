# Problem Statement:

**awk**

While monitoring the performance of an Nginx web server, we often need to analyze access logs to extract meaningful insights. For this task, we aim to process the logs generated by a custom-built Nginx Docker container. The goal is to analyze server activity and derive critical metrics from the logs. Specifically, we need to:


1. Identify and list all unique IP addresses that have sent requests to the server.
2. Count the number of successful responses (HTTP status code 200).
3. Count the number of cached responses (HTTP status code 304).

By solving this problem, we can gain a deeper understanding of server usage patterns, evaluate client activity, and optimize performance where necessary. The solution should emphasize efficiency and clarity, leveraging text manipulation tools like `awk`, `sed`, `grep`, and `tr` to parse and process the logs.


```
docker logs custome-nginx > nginx.log
```


I used a script to generate report

**sed**

i already given this in jenkins pipeline where i need to updated deploymnent file image for every new build
